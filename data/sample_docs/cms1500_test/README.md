# CMS-1500 Test Set

Place 5-10 filled CMS-1500 forms here for evaluation.

- Include a mix of printed and handwritten examples.
- Preferred naming: `cms1500_handwritten_01.pdf`, `cms1500_printed_01.pdf`, etc.
- Keep one form per file (page 1 only).
- Do not commit PHI/PII. Redact if necessary before syncing.
